# description

# This example show patterns that can be used to implement an admin app, that allows
# users to see data records, create new new data records, edit those records and delete
# those records.

# This example will contain a set of brands, and a set of products.

# A one-to-many relation will be created between the brands and the products.
# Each product will be related to one brand, and a brand can be related to many products.

# Define all the data connections, in this case the brands and products MongoDB collections.
connections:
  - id: brands # The connectionId that will be used when defining requests and mutations on our pages.
    type: MongoDBCollection # The type of connection
    properties:
      databaseName: example-crud # The database name.
      collection: brands # The collection name.
      databaseUri:
        _secret: EXAMPLES_MDB # The database connection uri that is stored as a secret and accessed using the _secret operator.
      write: true # Allows writes to the database. By default reads are allowed but writes are not.
  - id: products
    type: MongoDBCollection
    properties:
      databaseName: example-crud
      collection: products
      databaseUri:
        _secret: EXAMPLES_MDB
      write: true

# Menus used in the app can be listed here
# By default, the menu with id default, or the first menu defined is used.
# If no menu is defined, a default menu is created using all the defined pages.
menus:
  - id: default
    links:
      - id: brands # Define the menu link that directs to the brands page.
        type: MenuLink
        pageId: brands # Id of the brands page.
        properties:
          title: Brands # Title to show on the menu.
          icon: ShopOutlined # Give the menu item a icon, see a list of all availible icons at https://ant.design/components/icon/
      - id: products
        type: MenuLink
        pageId: products
        properties:
          title: Products
          icon: RestOutlined
 
# All the pages in the app are listed here.
# Instead of defining the page in the lowdefy.yaml file, it is defined in its own yaml file and referenced here.
pages:
  # For brands, a simpler pattern of creating new pages for the new and edit brand actions will be used.
  - _ref: brands.yaml
  - _ref: new_brand.yaml
  - _ref: edit_brand.yaml
  # For products, the edit and new brand actions will be included on the same page. This is more complex,
  # but results in a better user experience.
  - _ref: products.yaml
