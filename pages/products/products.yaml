# On this page, we will handle both the edit and create product actions on the same page.

# We will create separate forms for the new product and edit product forms. This is simpler
# than sharing the form. Sometimes additional actions and conditional logic are needed to manage
# these shared forms.

# To simplify the state on the page context, we will give ids that look like new_product.{fieldName}
# and edit_product.{fieldName} to the input components. This will create separate objects in
# the page state, that will make managing them easier. We also set the response value of the
# all_products request to the product_list field in state because our product_list List block
# will render the blocks defined under product_list for all the array items in the product_list
# state variable.

# All the requests are placed on the page object, so they are all together.
